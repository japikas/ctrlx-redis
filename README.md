> Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, Redis offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most popular NoSQL database and one of the most popular databases overall. - _Wikipedia_
